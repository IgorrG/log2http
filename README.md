# log2http

Very much in progress. Nothing to see here yet.

log2http watches log files and sends new contents to a specified http endpoint.

# Usage

FIXME: Setup config
FIXME: Launch
FIXME: Try it out with: `for i in {1..6}; do echo "hello world" >> example.log; done`

# Local development

Run tests with `pytest`.

Run static type checking with `mypy --ignore-missing-imports log2http`.
